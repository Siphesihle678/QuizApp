# 🚀 Quiz App Deployment Guide

## 📋 Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the enhanced Quiz App with the new Database Assessment integration.

## ✅ Integration Summary
- **Enhanced Database Assessment**: `CAT_Grade11_Database_Assessment_Enhanced.html`
- **Guide Modal**: Comprehensive step-by-step instructions for all assessment questions
- **View Guide Button**: Prominently placed in the activity header
- **New Route**: `/database-assessment` added to Flask app
- **Main Page Update**: New activity card added to the interface

## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps
1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Development with Cursor AI\QuizApp"
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the Flask application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   - Open your web browser
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`
   - You should see the Quiz App main page with the new "Database Assessment" card

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### Option 1: Traditional Web Server

1. **Upload files to your web server:**
   - Upload all files from the QuizApp directory
   - Ensure `app.py` and all HTML files are in the same directory

2. **Install dependencies on the server:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run with gunicorn (recommended for production):**
   ```bash
   gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:5000
   ```

4. **Configure web server (Apache/Nginx):**
   - Set up reverse proxy to forward requests to the Flask app
   - Configure SSL certificates for HTTPS

### Option 2: Cloud Platform Deployment

#### Railway Deployment
1. **Create Railway account** and connect your repository
2. **Railway will automatically detect** the Flask app from `app.py`
3. **Environment variables** are handled automatically
4. **Deploy** - Railway will build and deploy your app

#### Heroku Deployment
1. **Create Heroku account** and install Heroku CLI
2. **Initialize git repository** (if not already done)
3. **Create Heroku app:**
   ```bash
   heroku create your-quiz-app-name
   ```
4. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```

```

## 🔍 Testing the Deployment

### 1. Test the Main Page
- Navigate to the root URL (`/`)
- Verify the "Database Assessment" card appears
- Check that all existing functionality works

### 2. Test the New Database Assessment
- Click on the "Database Assessment" card
- Verify the enhanced assessment loads correctly
- Test the "View Guide" button functionality
- Ensure the modal opens with comprehensive instructions

### 3. Test Guide Features
- Click "View Guide" button
- Verify modal opens with proper styling
- Check that all sections are accessible
- Test mobile responsiveness
- Verify print functionality (guide should be hidden when printing)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'**
   - Solution: Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Port already in use**
   - Solution: Change port in `app.py` or kill existing process

3. **File not found errors**
   - Solution: Ensure all HTML files are in the same directory as `app.py`

4. **Database errors**
   - Solution: The app will automatically create the SQLite database on first run

### Debug Mode
To run in debug mode for development:
```python
# In app.py, change the last line to:
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port, debug=True)
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Maintenance

### Logs
- Flask logs will show request information
- Check for any 404 errors or missing files
- Monitor database submissions

### Database
- SQLite database file: `quiz_results.db`
- Backup regularly for production use
- Consider migrating to PostgreSQL for high-traffic deployments

### Performance
- The app is lightweight and should handle moderate traffic
- For high-traffic scenarios, consider:
  - Using a production WSGI server (gunicorn)
  - Implementing caching
  - Using a production database

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Change default credentials** in `app.py`:
   ```python
   TEACHER_CREDENTIALS = {
       'your_username': hashlib.sha256('your_secure_password'.encode()).hexdigest()
   }
   ```

2. **Update secret key**:
   ```python
   app.secret_key = 'your-secure-secret-key-here'
   ```

3. **Enable HTTPS** in production
4. **Regular security updates** for dependencies
